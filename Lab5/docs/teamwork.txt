2.    Arnav - helped in figuring out the state transition diagram for the 4 bit fir filter. Helped in debugging the fir_filter.
      Sam - helped in figuring out the state diagram for the 4 bit fir filter. 
 
3.    We met 3 times and worked on the lab.

4.    I helped in resolving errors in state diagram for 4 bit filter by notifying of modwait to be an output from a flip flop. I helped in debugging the code for the ZERO stae. I helped in explaining the controller block functionality.

5.    Sam helped in correcting me for the logic of next_modwait and curr_modwait for the modwait signal in 4 bit fir filter.

6.    I did not use any testbench from piazza. I added more testcases and debugging statements for printing to point me towards the source of the error.
