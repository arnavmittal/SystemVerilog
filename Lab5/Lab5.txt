How are the image files different? Does this make sense given the filter design built in the lab? Why or why not?
The image files are clearer. filter3 is the most clear file, filter1 is the least clear file. Assuming we made a high pass filter this makes sense.

What is the general syntax for each of the file IO functions used in the provided test bench (tb_fir_filter_image.sv)?
$fopen(FILENAME, mode)
$fclose(Var) where Variable is the value of $fopen(FILENAME, mode)
$fscanf(Var,"%c" , Store_Variable);

What are the different format specifiers available for use in file functions like $fscanf(...)?
fscanf has %c
fopen has %rb
